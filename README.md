# Lampify
Lampify is an interactive simulation inspired by Conway's Game of Life, built using BreezyPythonGUI and tkinter. It features a grid of lamps that evolve based on simple rules. Users can randomize the grid, run the simulation automatically or step-by-step, and save or load grid configurations.
