## Overview

Lampify is a computer science UNI project: an interactive simulation application inspired by cellular automata, particularly Conway's Game of Life. It features a grid of lamps that evolve over time based on simple rules. This project is built using Python's BreezyPythonGUI and tkinter libraries to provide a graphical user interface for visualization and interaction.

## Features

- **Randomize**: Populate the grid with a random configuration of lit and unlit bulbs.
- **Auto Run**: Start the automatic evolution of the grid.
- **Run Step**: Advance the grid evolution by one step.
- **Stop**: Halt the automatic evolution.
- **Reset**: Clear the grid and reset the generation counter.
- **Save**: Save the current grid configuration to a text file.
- **Open**: Load a grid configuration from a text file.
